                <h3> Bantu knots</h3>

                    <p id="Brief-History">Bantu knots are a traditional African hairstyle that has been around for over 100 years.
                    "Bantu" is a comprehensive term used to describe the 300 to 600 ethnic groups within southern Africa that spoke 
                    the Bantu language, according to the South Africa His flex-direction: row;tory Organization (SAHO). However, it is important to mention
                    that Bantu speaking people are not a homogeneous group. In fact, SAHO discloses that there are over 100 million people
                    speaking variations of the Bantu language in southern and central Africa who speak about 700 languages, including several dialects. 
                    Interestingly though, across these regions "Abantu" (or Bantu as used by colonists) is recognized as the Zulu word for people in most 
                    languages."It is the plural of the word 'umuntu', meaning 'person', and is based on the stem '--ntu' plus the plural prefix 'aba'."(naturallycurly.com)</p>

                    <p>The Zulu people of southern Africa originated Bantu knots, 
                    a hairstyle where the hair is sectioned off, twisted, and wrapped in a such a
                    way that the hair stacks upon itself to form a spiraled knot(byrdie.com). </p>

            <div id="cornrows" class="hair-information">
                <h3> Cornrows </h3>
               
                <p id="Brief-History"> Cornrows or canerows are a traditional style of braids in which the hair is braided very
                      close to the scalp, using an underhand, upward motion to make a continuous, raised row.Cornrows are often done in simple, straight lines, as the term implies,
                      but they can also be styled in elaborate geometric or curvilinear designs. Depending on the region of the world, cornrows are worn by both genders, and are in 
                      few occasions adorned with beads, hair cuffs or cowry shells. The duration of weaving cornrow braids may take up to about 5 hours, depending on its quantity and width.
                      Often favored for their easy maintenance, cornrows can be left in for weeks at a time if maintained through careful washing of the hair and natural oiling of the scalp.
                      Braids are considered a protective styling on African curly hair as they allow for easy and restorative growth(wikipedia.com). Cornrows helps protect the hair from moisture
                      loss and breakage which is why cornrows, and many other braided looks are classified as "protective" styles. The braiding technique is technology-first at its core, focusing
                      on braiding various patterns (from straight to zig-zag) against your scalp (byrdie.com).</p>

                <h3> Braids </h3>
               
                <p id="Brief-History"> The history of braids dates back to 3500 BC. In other words, they go way, way back. It's safe to say the style has maintained a historical legacy that's here to stay. 
                    From classic cornrows and simple three-strand braids to Dutch braids and more, this symbolic style has been a sign of societal status, ethnicity, religion, and more. Braids can be done 
                    with or without knots. knotless braids don't have the traditional knot you likely grew up with at the start of each braid. Knotless braids uses the feed-in technique, infusing the hair 
                    mid-braid to create a lightweight braid that some would call more natural-looking. the braids are coveted for their comfort and ease on the hairline. "Knotless braids are definitely a
                    better option because [they put] less stress and tension on the hair and scalp (byrdie.com).</p>

            <div id="dreadlocs" class="hair-information">
                <h3> Dreadlocs </h3>
              
                <p id="Brief-History"> Dreadlocs, also referred to as dreads or locs, are sections of hair that are matted and “locked” into place. Dreadlocks are typically done in small sections to 
                    create a look that is similar to hanging braids. Some of the earliest depictions of dreadlocks date back as far as 1600-1500 BCE in the Minoan Civilization, one of Europe's earliest
                    civilizations, centred in Crete (now part of Greece). Frescoes discovered on the Aegean island of Thera (modern Santorini, Greece) depict individuals with long braided hair or long
                    dreadlocks. In ancient Egypt, examples of Egyptians wearing locked hairstyles and wigs have appeared on bas-reliefs, statuary and other artifacts. Mummified remains of Egyptians with 
                    locked wigs have also been recovered from archaeological sites. During the Bronze Age and Iron Age many peoples in the Near East, Anatolia, Caucasus, East Mediterranean and North Africa
                    such as the Sumerians, Elamites and Ancient Egyptians were depicted in art with braided or plaited hair and beards. However, braids are not dreadlocks, and it is not always possible to 
                    tell from these images which are being depicted.(wikipedia.com)</p>

            <div id="twist" class="hair-information">
                <h3> Twists </h3>
               
                <p id="Brief-History">Twists are an ideal protective style with a bonus. This is because they may lock in moisture. While flat twists work well on different textures, twists generally work better on completely 
                    natural hair as the ends usually hold together without additional help from bands or barrettes. Twists can be combined with other styles, such as flat twists, braids, and afros. Adding extensions
                    isn't a requirement when creating twists, but if you want a longer-lasting, fuller style adding synthetic hair is your best bet affording you the option to create twisted styles like Senegalese or
                    Marley twists. You can also add in colored extension hair if you want to create a funky or different look than your usual one. Besides adding extensions to help your twists last longer, wearing a
                    satin scarf or bonnet at night and refreshing your hair with moisture is a must (byrdie.com). </p>

            <div id="crochet" class="hair-information">
                <h3>Crochet Braiding </h3>
                <p id="Brief-History">Crochet braiding, sometimes referred to as latch hook braiding, is a method of hair styling that's typically used to create length or simply protect one's natural hair. 
                    The style is held together by a base of cornrowed hair to which hair extensions are then attached. Crochet braids are typically easy to maintain and provide a great way to protect your hair 
                    from excessive styling and heat damage. They are quick to install, easy to manage, and generally inexpensive. Crochet braids are great options because they allow for the scalp to be free and
                    don't interfere with the hair's natural edges. They are easy to maintain without worrying about tracks or wefts coming loose, and some even age into brand new styles completely. </p>
