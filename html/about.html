                Afro-textured or kinky hair is the hair texture of populations in Africa. Each strand of this hair type grows in a tiny angle-like helix shape. 
                The overall effect is such that when contrasted with straight, wavy or curly hair, afro-textured hair appears denser. Ajectives such as "woolly", "kinky",
               "nappy", or "spiraled" have been used to describe natural afro-textured hair. More formally, ulotrichous ("curly-haired", Greek οὐλότριχος, from οὖλος 'woolly,
               fleecy' and θρίξ 'hair') refers to afro-textured hair, its antonym being leiotrichous ("smooth-haired"). In 1997, hairstylist Andre Walker created a numerical
               grading system for human hair types.The Andre Walker Hair Typing System classifies afro-textured hair as 'type 4' (there are other types of hair, defined as
               type 1 for straight hair, type 2 for wavy, and type 3 for curly, with the letters A, B, and C used as indicators of the degree of coil variation in each type), with
               the subcategory of type 4C being most exemplary of the afro-textured hair. However, afro-textured hair is often difficult to categorize because of the many different
               variations among individuals. Those variations include pattern (mainly tight coils), density (sparse to dense), strand diameter (fine, medium, coarse), and feel (cottony, woolly, spongy).
               Different genetic groups have observable differences in the structure, density, and growth rate of hair. With regard to structure, all human hair has the same basic chemical composition in 
               terms of keratin protein content. Franbourg et al. have found that black hair may differ in the distribution of lipids throughout the hair shaft. Classical afro-textured hair has been found
               to be not as densely concentrated on the scalp as other follicle types. Specifically, the average density of afro-textured hair was found to be approximately 190 hairs per square centimeter. 
               This was significantly lower than that of European hair, which, on average, has approximately 227 hairs per square centimeter. Loussourarn found that afro-textured hair grows at an average rate 
               of approximately 256 micrometers per day, whereas European-textured straight hair grows at approximately 396 micrometers per day. In addition, due to a phenomenon called 'shrinkage', kinky 
               hair that is a given length when stretched straight can appear much shorter when allowed to naturally coil. Shrinkage is most evident when afro-textured hair is (or has recently been) wet. 
               The more coiled the hair texture, the higher its shrinkage. The shape of the hair follicle determines the hair's curliness. An individual hair's shape is never completely circular. The cross-section 
               of a hair is an ellipse, which can tend towards a circle or be distinctly flattened. East Asiatic heads of straight hair are formed from almost-round hair follicles producing straight hair, and European
               hair follicle forms oval shapes which produce wavy hair. Afro-textured hair has a flattened cross-section and is finer, and its ringlets can form tight circles with diameters of only a few millimeters. 
               In humans worldwide, East Asiatic-textured hair is the most common, whereas kinky hair is the least common. This is because the former hair texture is typical of the large populations inhabiting the Far
               East as well as the indigenous peoples of the Americas (wikipedia).
